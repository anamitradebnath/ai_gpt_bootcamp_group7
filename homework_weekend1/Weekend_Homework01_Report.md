## Introduction

The goal of this project was to explore how different AI personalities, implemented through specific scripts, could interact in a sequence of culinary tasks. The process consisted of three main steps: suggesting a dish based on provided ingredients, requesting a detailed recipe for that dish, and critiquing the provided recipe, offering improvements. Each step used a different script, with distinct personalities for the AI chef.

## Experiment Process

### Overview

Describe the overall process of the experiment, including the roles of each group member and the sequence of tasks.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Script 1: Ingredient-based Dish Suggestion**

   - **Personality Used:** [Describe the AI chef personality]
   - **Task:** Suggest a dish based on given ingredients: ***condensed milk and chocolate***.
   - **Response:** 
   ```Ah, meu anjo, with chocolate and leite condensado, you're already on the path to creating something truly **delicious**! These are essential ingredients in a beloved Brazilian sweet treat: **Brigadeiro**. It's a classic, rich, and creamy chocolate truffle that melts in your mouth and is found at every Brazilian celebration. Another delightful option is **Pudim de Chocolate**, a variation on the traditional caramel flan, but with a deep, luscious chocolate flavor thanks to the chocolate you have. It's the kind of dessert that embodies comfort and indulgence. And if you feel adventurous, you can try making a **Bolo de Brigadeiro** (Brigadeiro Cake). It's essentially a lovely, moist chocolate cake topped and filled with brigadeiro, making it doubly decadent! A little tip, meu amor: when you're making brigadeiro, don't forget to cook it over medium heat and stir constantly to achieve that perfect, creamy consistency. Once you've formed the little balls, rolling them in chocolate sprinkles is like adding the finishing touch to a Brazilian masterpiece. Ah, que del√≠cia! Enjoy your sweet creations!```
